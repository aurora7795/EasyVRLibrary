C# Port of the Arduino library for the EasyVR module by RoboTech-srl
This is a port of the Arduino library available at https://github.com/RoboTech-srl/EasyVR-Arduino included are some unit tests and a simple test harness that uses the library port to do some basic recognition and return some information from the module.

If you are new to using the Easy VR module, I recommend you install Easy VR commander (http://www.veear.eu/downloads/) and also a copy of Termite (https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm) - Easy VR Commander provides a means of configuring your module and can help verify your code is working. Termite is a simple but effective serial terminal for debugging your interactions with the module via the serial port.

This is my first GitHub project so my apologies if i'm not following procedures correctly - feel free to get in contact if you have any questions or problems! Twitter: mbradfordgago
